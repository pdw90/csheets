1. DESCRIPTION
=============
CleanSheets is the first spreadsheet application that is both extensible and
platform-independent. It features a formula language that closely resembles
that of Microsoft Excel, and extensions for aiding end-user programmers. The
application is based on the ANTLR compiler [1] generator and the JFC/Swing
JTable component.

2. PACKAGE CONTENTS
===================
bin - Contains scripts for performing various common actions
lib - Contains the application's JAR package and the supporting libraries
res - Contains resources necessary when compiling and running from source
src - Contains complete source code

3. RUNNING THE PROGRAM
======================
In the bin directory, use either a run script to run CleanSheets from its JAR
package or use a build script to compile and run it from the included source
code.

4. SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
======================
CleanSheets requires the Java 2 Platform Standard Edition 5.0 [2]. Also
required is the included library for the ANTLR compiler generator
(lib/antlr.jar).
